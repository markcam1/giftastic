This production allows a user to display GIFs (Graphics Interchange Format)
using prepopulated buttons or adding their own buttons that call the 
[Giphy-api]( https://developers.giphy.com/).

Other features include:
1.	Double-clicking the GIF to animate or halt the GIF animation
2.	Adding/removing GIF/s to favorites and saving to local storage
3.	Taking users to the download site

This production employs HTML, the HTML5’s data-attributes, JavaScript/jQuery and ajax calls.
